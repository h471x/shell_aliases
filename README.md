 ## Description ##

 Delightful aliases to make your life easier while
 using the Linux Command Line Interface,
 more smooth CLI navigation and more !

 ## Installation ##

 $ chmod +x install.sh
 $ ./install.sh

 ## Remove / Restore ##

 After the installation, a file named "uninstall.sh" 
 will be generated, just execute the following command
 to uninstall aliases and restore your 
 shell configuration file (.$SHELLrc) to default :

 $ ./uninstall.sh

 ! Careful, do not delete the directory that contains
 that repo before launching this shell script otherwise
 your .$SHELLrc won't be restored as expected

 ## Note ##

 All the shortcuts are basic but I have just
 implemented the "alias cv" which is the main
 alias used for the most of all,

 (yup it's called everytime we make a command)

 it will just give you "a lookalike" GUI
 when using the CLI !

 Enjoy !!
